\section*{\centering Abstract}

The Database Visualiser project is a teaching tool for SQL learners. It visualises their database structure which will make it easier to determine if there are any flaws in their design. It is a website built using native JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 for styling and design. This project was managed using Agile methodologies and a Kanban board. The visualiser can take in either a file as input or a text area where text can be pasted into, from this it will validate the SQL and visualise the database and advise the user on errors and flaws that are present. These include but are not limited to: missing primary keys, missing foreign keys between tables and setting foreign keys to a column which is not a primary key. This website can also be used in marking to automate spotting obvious errors or in teaching to provide a sanity checker for students to use before submission. It also provides a syntax highlighter which if the SQL compiles it will highlight and indent the SQL with filters to identify each type of column types.
